$ git checkout v3.0 -b quote
Under the file diffutilsmodified, I used this command to check out v3.0 of 
Diffutils into a new branch called quote.

$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
I used this command to install the changes into this new branch.

Then I used emacs to enter the six .c files, and used C-x 4 a to update 
ChangeLog.

$ git add .
$ git commit -F ChangeLog
I used these two commands to commit changew to the new branch and used the 
ChangeLog entry as commit message.

$ git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
This command generated a patch called formatte-patch.txt.

$ git checkout v3.0 -b partner
Switch to a new branch called partner.

$ git am < formatted-patch.txt
Apply the patch with this command.
My partner is Yiwei Sun.

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
Build the resulting system.

$ make distdir
$ emacs diffutils*/ChangeLog
By inspection, this file contains all the ChangeLog entries from my own 
ChangeLog.

Using X11.
$cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
Change into the directory specified in the assignment instructions.

$ export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
$ gitk
Then see the description in file gitk-description.txt.
