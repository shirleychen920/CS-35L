I grabbed Coreutils 7.6 by using:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

To decompress the file, I used:
tar -zxvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

Then I made a temporary directory by using:
mkdir coreutilsInstall

In order to run the configure script, I used:cd ./coreuti
ls-7.6 to change into the file's directory, then used:pwd
 coreutilsInstall to get the absolute path of the tempora
ry directory I created.

Then, I ran the configure script by using:
./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/haojie/coreutilsInstall

Then I ran these commands:
make
make install
in order to compile and install the application.

I used:cd coreutils-7.6/src to go to the source file
directory, then opened ls.c and applied the patch using emacs.

Then I ran the command "make" to build the fixed version.
It showed that these files were updated:
CC ls.o
CCLD dir
CCLD vdir
CCLD ls
These were updated becuase we had modified the object file
 ls.c, so the link and executable files were needed to be 
updated.

I ran these command and compare them to make sure the patch
 worked:
./ls -l /bin/bash
ls -l /bin/bash

The first command above generated the desired result.

Then for testing reason, I created a new file called test1,
 and used the command: touch -t 201401210959.30 test2 to c
reate a file called test2 that has a modification date more
 than one year from now.

Tests succedded.
